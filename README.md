# Codebased

Codebased is the most powerful code search tool that runs on your computer.

Here's why it's great:
- Search, simplified: Combines semantic and full-text search to find what you're looking for, not just what you typed.
- Search code, not just text: Searches for complete code structures, not just lines of text, in 11 languages.
- Ignores uninteresting files: Respects your `.gitignore` file(s) and ignores hidden directories.
- Instant editing: Selecting a search result opens your favorite editor at the correct file and line number.
- Fast: Indexes your code in seconds, searches in milliseconds, and updates in real-time as you edit your code.
- Open-source, runs locally: No code is stored on remote servers.
