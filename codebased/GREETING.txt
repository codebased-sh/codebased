Hello and welcome to Codebased, a suite of tools to make software development fast and painless.
I'm Max Conradt, founder of Codebased.
I'm creating Codebased because I love writing software and love people who write software.
If you ever need any help, text me at +1 (913) 808-7343. For now, I will even help you write your code.
You can also check out the Discord: https://discord.gg/CA6Jzn2S. I'll be more responsive on Discord.
That's my real phone number, because Codebased will never be anything without its users.
